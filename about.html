            Hello I’m Afyia.
            <br>
            <p class="double-space">I’m originally from a little place called Brooklyn. I’ve been living in Orlando, FL for a few years now and loving the south more and more every day.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space"> My creative journey started as a kid where I had a love for art, fashion, and journalism. I would cut images from the NY Times Style section and
            recreate fashion spreads in my scrapbook. I also loved to draw and thought I could become a Fashion Illustrator. I enrolled in an art school but
            dropped out after 2 years because the stereotype of a starving artist scared me. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space"> I reconciled myself to a less creative but more economically stable career. I chose to go back to school and become a “professional”. I earned
             BA & MA in Communications & New Media and for the next 15 years climbed the corporate ladder landing various roles in customer service, project
             management, training delivery & development and business continuity planning.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space"> Still, I missed being creative. I wanted to make things that would be admired both for its beauty and function. But even though I wanted to do
             creative things, the vision of a creative career still felt so out of reach for me. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space"> When I became a mom, accessibility and inclusivity issues began to interest me. I started to think about a world more inclusive of people
            living with disabilities. This was my lightbulb moment. I saw an opportunity to be creative in a meaningful way and I began to shift my thinking
            towards design.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space"> Once I realized that design was about creating a better experience for people I knew that was what I wanted to do. I made the decision to change
            careers and enrolled in a UX/UI design apprenticeship program where I learn how to create inclusive experiences using human-centered design processes. <br>
            I love that as a designer I get to do more than solve my own problems - I think about how to design for everyone. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="double-space">Let’s make good things!</p>
