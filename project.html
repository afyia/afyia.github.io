      <h2> Cobalt</h2>
      <h1> Modern Cloud Storage </h1>
      <p>Cobalt provides a practical solution for design teams to store and retrieve data</p>

      <section class="Overview">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Creating, sharing and collaborati ng on design concepts can be frustrating. Design
          teams need practical solutions to create, share and save content online. Cobalt is
          part cloud-storage, part collaboration tool and entirely secure. It enables design
          teams to create and share work their way.</p>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>UX/UI Design | UX Research | Branding </p>
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p> 8 Weeks</p>
      <section class="Design Process">
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h4> <a href="">View Survey</a> </h4>
        <p>To understand what features users might want, and how they would use the application,
          I conducted a survey to gain insight into cloud storage usage. Initially my goal was to
          understand the behaviors and motivations of cloud storage users but in the process of surveying
          a wide target audience I accidentally found a niche.</p>
        <h1>in the process of surveying a target audience I accidentally found a niche </h1>
        <p>Coincidentally, a large number of survey participants were in the creative field from freelancers
          to UX/UI design students, and even a few photographers, etc. They all shared the same frustration with
          saving, sharing and collaborating on design concepts.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <h1>94%</h1>
        <p> of users have used a cloud storage app</p>
        <h1>40%</h1>
        <p> of users share content with colleagues</p>
        <h1>37%</h1>
        <p> of users want better collaboration features</p>
      <section class="Competitive Analysis">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>Carrying out a thorough analysis of the competition was necessary in determining if the niche would be successful.
          There are a number big-name competitors in this space – Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Each of these offer
          essentially the same types of services: fast-sync, file, folder and link sharing, and the ability to invite collaborators.
          There’s really no surprise here – these features are typical of most cloud storage providers.</p>
        <h2>"Don't reinvent the wheel!"</h2>
        <p> What did surprise me were the lack of cloud storage applications targeting creative teams and their specific requirements.
          I quickly determined that creative teams would be a good type of consumer for this product. Also, targeting a niche consumer
          could help us stand out among the competition.</p>
      <section class="User Persona">
        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <p>The participants of my user survey provided the foundation for my personas. I took into consideration their behaviors and
           motivations for using a cloud storage application.</p>
      <section class="user stories">
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>I created user stories to help determine and prioritize the important features for users. These were created based only on
          the minimum viable product.</p>
      <section class="user flows">
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Results</a></h4>
        <p>I converted the users’ stories into user flows to visualize how users would accomplish specific tasks. I created separate
          flows to demonstrate how new and returning users would be welcomed into the platform. I also created combined flows for
          dashboard tasks. These took several iterations as I wanted to map out  the smoothest path for adding content and sharing files.</p>
      <section class="lofi wireframes">
        <h2>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Results</a></h4>
        <p>I created wireframes for the landing page first, as this would be where potential users would learn about Cobalt. I wanted a layout
          that was clean and easily conveyed information to new users. I created a few versions that started with a large hero image to capture
          attention, a section for features, dashboard demo and testimonials.</p>
      <section class="hifi wireframes">
        <h2>Hi-Fi Wireframes</h2>
        <h4>V<a href="">View Results</a></h4>
        <p>I created wireframes for the landing page first, as this would be where potential users would learn about Cobalt. I wanted a layout
          that was clean and easily conveyed information to new users. I created a few versions that started with a large hero image to capture
          attention, a section for features, dashboard demo and testimonials.</p>
      <section class="naming">
        <h2>Naming</h2>
        <p>With the wireframes in place I began work on the branding . My first step was to come up with a name for the product.  I created a mind
          map with a simple goal of something that was easy to read and write. I settled on “Cobalt” which I thought was a unique name for a
          cloud-storage application.</p>
      <section class="logo concept">
        <h2>Logo Concept</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Sketches</a></h4>
        <p>I sketched with pen & paper to explore different logo solutions. I wanted both a logo and wordmark which could be used interchangeably.</p>
      <section class="Branding">
        <h1>Branding</h1>
        <h2>Master Logo</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Styleguide</a></h4>
        <p>The final Cobalt logo is bold, clear and impactful and symbolizes what the brand stands for which is to bring focus and clarity to design teams.</p>
        <h2>Color Palette</h2>
        <p>The color palette consists of a cool ice blue , warm tangerine red and a cobalt color which is the cornerstone of the Cobalt brand helping to
           distinguish it from other cloud services.</p>
        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p>I used a combination of the Ultra font for headers and the Open Sans for body copy- these work together for a bold yet simple design. I kept the font
          choices very limited and used familiar typefaces so as not to stray too far from what customers were accustomed to.</p>
        <h2>Images/Icons</h2>
        <p>Most cloud services come across as serious and stuffy; I wanted Cobalt to stand out as an upbeat, trustworthy and friendly product. I decided to use
           digital illustrations as a way to show off our creative side.</p>
        <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Results</a></h4>
        <p>With the branding work, I created high fidelity mockups and conducted both in-person and remote preference testing  on button designs, icon styling and
          color choices.</p>
        <h2>Final Mockups</h2>
        <h4><a href="">View Prototype</a></h4>
        <section class="Lessons">
          <h1>What I learned</h1>
          <h1>1</h1>
          <p>User research & constant reiterations are important and necessary steps.</p>
          <h1>2</h1>
          <p>Accepting that “I am not my user” allowed me to focus on creating a product that addressed users’ primary goals.</p>
          <h1>3</h1>
          <p>If I had to do anything different, I would spend more time on microcopy. I used illustrations to communicate emotions and moods.</p>
          <h1>4</h1>
          <p>The most valuable lesson learned is that UX/UI is not about reinventing the wheel, but about considering intuitive solutions that work
             best for the situation.</p>
